                <p>
                I started my long carreer as a minor poltergeist haunting the bed chamber of the ancient Hittite king Uriah.  Even in my early days, 
                I had a natural talent for moral corruption and the reaping of souls.
                </p>
                <p>
                I gained the attention of several of the greater demons and rapidly worked my way up the chain of command.  I have been known by 
                several other names such as Lord Baal, Moloch and Bahamut.  I currently hold the position of the lord of the shadow demons and 
                I am responsible for the management of over 20,000 corrupted souls.
                </p>
                <p>
                When I'm not busy consuming the spirits of the dammned, I enjoy hanging out with my cat Whiskers.  I also enjoy watching unboxing 
                videos on Youtube and listening to the Backstreet Boys.
                </p>
                <p>
                Looking forward to the future, I'm hoping the experience I gain from the coding boot camp will lead to a position outside 
                the realm of soul corruption and harvesting.  I would like to move into web development and even someday find myself occupying the 
                position of the Dark Harbinger of Web Services.
